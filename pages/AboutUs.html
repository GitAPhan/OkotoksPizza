                    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
                    <p>Ken and Elaine Spinato opened their first pizzeria after moving from Chicago to Phoenix with
                        their
                        infant daughter Nicole in 1974. Within a year, their son Anthony was born. Over the next 40
                        years,
                        Spinato's grew through word-of-mouth thanks to our authentic Italian flavors and family
                        atmosphere.
                        Every guest was (and still is) treated like a member of the family, focusing on the guest to
                        provide
                        the food and the ambiance that inspired a family legacy.</p>
